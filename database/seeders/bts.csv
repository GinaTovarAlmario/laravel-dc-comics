Each member flexed their musical prowess by taking part in creating the lyrics and music for every song on the album. BTS has repeatedly said that “hip hop is genuine music for telling one’s own story,” and indeed the members rap about their own experiences and emotions. There is no discontinuity between the emotions and lyrics of BTS. The album is a satisfaction in both quality and quantity."

Lyrics that brutally lay open reality as it is deliver a bold admonition to a world that inflicts despair. Children are raised as studying machines without a chance to think about the future.
A world where classmates are not friends but competitors trying to trample each other. BTS sings about the wounds and anguish that such hopeless life has left on today’s teens. "

The songs spoke about young people living without a dream and schools that force rigid and homogenous thought onto its students. The new album, released on February 12, continues to focus on school and teens. As hinted by the title, SKOOL LUV AFFAIR, the album’s main theme is the love that blossoms in the school. This album is a culmination of the “School Trilogy” project that discusses the topics of most interest to teens their own age—dreams, happiness and love. Such penetrating insight into the hearts and minds of young people led to the absolute support that BTS has received from fans their age. The members again directly participated in the making of the songs, vowing to ensure that the songs reflect the reality of the music fans of their own generation."

They have become tougher, singing that their love is not to be treated lightly. A year and two months into their debut, BTS made sure that the visuals, performance and all the elements of their first studio album are flawless. Tracks that highlight the different genres of hip hop—South, West, Boom Bap and Trap—provide a clear direction of BTS' music. The title track “Danger” is a tightly-composed hybrid hip hop song with a piercing punk-rock guitar sound that features stark rap, a powerful hook and exhilarating shouting."

In each track are distilled poetic and pop emotions that allows the listener to sense both the soft and the resounding musical transformation of the group.
After successfully concluding the “School Trilogy” that discusses the main topics of interest for teens—dreams, happiness and love—the new album begins to discuss “youth”. BTS has chosen the theme of “the most beautiful moment in life”, the start of one’s young adulthood in which beauty coexists with uncertainty.
The most beautiful moment in life pt.1 focuses on the uncertain future more than the glamour of youth. In addition, while previous lyrical work had been credited to the rappers (RM, SUGA and j-hope), the vocal members (Jin, Jimin, V, Jung Kook) have now added their names to the credits for this album’s producing and songwriting."

Now entering their young adulthood, the members of BTS sang in their previous album, The most beautiful moment in life pt.1, about people their age being threatened by uncertainty. Released seven months after that first installment, The most beautiful moment in life pt.2 sings about the energy of youth barreling forward, embracing even the uncertainty and insecurity. Now beginning to taste the bitterness of grown-up life, they can easily sense that life isn't always beautiful. However, they continue to sprint forward, relying only on their two destitute legs and the fire in their hearts. There’s nothing else to do but keep running. Facing the powerlessness of one’s youth, they collide and shatter and still cry out that “it’s okay to fall, it’s okay to get hurt.” That is the beauty of this moment.
Continuing the tradition of the previous album, the members including RM, SUGA, j-hope, V and Jung Kook add their names to the producing and songwriting credits, showing their own growth as musicians. The lyrics are more profound and the music more passionate. The “Youth Series” concludes with The most beautiful moment in life pt.2, but the boys are only now on the starting line. “Never Mind”, BTS is just getting started."

The first chapter of this story, “MAP OF THE SOUL : PERSONA”, sang about the world and the joy of love, and the discovery of the self as it is displayed to the world; “MAP OF THE SOUL : 7” now turns inward to the shadow within in a candid acknowledgement that it, too, is part of the self.

“MAP OF THE SOUL : 7” looks back on the past seven years of BTS since their debut as seven members of one team. The journey was not always smooth sailing, and there were special travails that they had to endure in their rise as global superstars. Now, understanding that the scars left by those hardships is a part of their real selves, BTS accepts both “the self I want to show” and the “self I want to scorn” to at last tell their own story of finding their “real and complete selves”.

Bridging fine art and popular art through such initiatives as the global art project CONNECT, BTS and the “Black Swan” art film featuring a modern dance interpretation of the early-release track, BTS is poised to show their latest growth as artist through “MAP OF THE SOUL : 7”."

BTS echoes in a low voice the comforting message that in the face of unexpected turns “Life Goes On” and extends their hands towards the future."
